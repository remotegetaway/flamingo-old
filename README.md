# Why dual license?

Flamingo is distributed under both an [All Rights Reserved](LICENSE.ASSETS.md) license for assets,
and an [LGPL license](LICENSE.CODE.md) for code.
We believe in supporting the wider modding community. Many modders use code examples 
to help them learn how to work with Minecraft and the mod loader they've chosen - 
while our code may not be of an absolutely professional quality, 
we hope that its availability helps someone else with their own modding work. 

To that end, feel free to look over our code for examples of how we've solved 
the problems we encountered while writing this mod, incorporate snippets into your own,
or even backport it - just remember that [our asset specific license](LICENSE.ASSETS.md) 
means that you can't take any of the models or textures for your own projects.

We reserve the right to enforce our copyright - via the DMCA (or other country-relevant legislation), 
acquisition of teeth, or sacrifice in our weekly demonic ritual.

# Forge

As an extra note, I want to put on record that we won't support the porting of our mods to Forge.
We don't own concepts and you can do whatever you want with ideas, but direct ports are NOT 
permitted, and you're not allowed to use the same models and textures if you decide
to make a similar mod on another modloader
